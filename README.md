Hi everyone! This is my final project for my Unstructured Data Analytics class at Notre Dame.
I scraped the top 30 most commonly reviewed beers in Illinois, got 495 reviews for each of them, filtered to only English comments, and made a text classification model based on them.
If you want to use it for yourself, you can just get the englishreviews.csv and reviewclassifier.rmd files and run them.
You can input a review of a hypothetical beer and it will give you a recommendation! So cool!
